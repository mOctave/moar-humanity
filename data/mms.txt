	`Marauding Max himself appears as you land. "You really shouldn't be carrying that stuff around here," he tells you, "I mean, really. So really, in fact, that I'm afraid I'm going to have to execute you terminally." While you're still trying to process the grammar of the previous sentence, Marauding Max pulls a rocket launcher out of his pocket and blasts you to smithereens, as well as producing a noticeable dent in your starship hull.`
